% This file is a sample of how to run sim_task1 (for tasks 1a and 1b).
%   param1 is the name of the first file to compare (e.g. '10.csv')
%   param2 is the name of the second file to compare (e.g. '2.csv')
%   param3 is the name of the distance function to use. There are 
%   two options at the moment:
%       'euclidean_func'
%       'dtw'
%

%sim_task1('11.csv','12.csv','euclidean_func');
sim_task1('11.csv','12.csv','dtw');
